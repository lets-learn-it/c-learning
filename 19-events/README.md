# Events

We will look at event subsystem in unix like (especially Linux) operating systems.

- **Hardware Interrupts**: These are signals generated by hardware devices to indicate that a particular event has occurred. For example, a network card may generate an interrupt when a new packet arrives.
- **Software Signals**: These are signals generated by software processes to indicate that a particular condition has occurred. For example, the SIGTERM signal is used to request that a process terminate.
- **Timers**: These are events generated by the kernel to indicate the expiration of a timer. For example, the kernel may generate a timer event to wake up a sleeping process after a specified amount of time has elapsed.
- **File Descriptor Events**: These are events generated when a file descriptor becomes available for reading or writing. For example, the epoll subsystem can be used to monitor file descriptors for events.
- **System Calls**: These are events generated by system calls to indicate that a particular operation has completed or that an error has occurred. For example, the poll system call can be used to wait for events on multiple file descriptors.
- **User Events**: These are events generated by user-level applications or libraries to indicate that a particular condition has occurred. For example, a GUI toolkit may generate an event when a button is clicked.

There are other types of events & custom events also.
