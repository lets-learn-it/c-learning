# restrict

- When we use `restrict` with a pointer ptr, it tells the compiler that ptr is the only way to access the object pointed by it, in other words, thereâ€™s no other pointer pointing to the same object.
- If a programmer uses restrict keyword and violate the above condition, the result is undefined behavior.
- restrict is not supported by C++. It is a C only keyword.
